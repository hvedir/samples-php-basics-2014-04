# Code Samples from PHP base trainings


## Environment setup

### to feel the awesomeness and power of Vagrant based development you need:

#### Only once:

* Install Oracle Virtualbox, also install GuestAddition for it (download on the same page)
* Install Vagrant
* [optionally] install vagrant plugin for your IDE (eg. NetBeans)
* Run {{vagrant up}} (from command line or IDE) in this directory and wait until all magic taking place

##### Each time

* just run {vagrant resume} when start working with project (it takes few seconds)
* open [http://localhost:8080] or [http://192.168.56.101] in browser and ... enjoy :)
* when end run {vagrant suspend}

of course its the most basic usage example, free to do anything you want
